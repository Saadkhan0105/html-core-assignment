    <h1>Full-Stack Web Development Technology Stacks</h1>
    <dl>
        
        <dt>MEAN Stack:</dt>
        <dd>
            The MEAN Stack consists of MongoDB (a NoSQL database), Express.js (a web application framework for Node.js), 
            Angular (a front-end JavaScript framework), and Node.js (a server-side JavaScript runtime).
            It is used for building scalable and efficient web applications.
        </dd>
        <br>

        <dt>MERN Stack:</dt>
        <dd>
            The MERN Stack includes MongoDB (database), Express.js (Node.js web application framework), React (front-end 
            JavaScript library), and Node.js (server-side JavaScript runtime). It is popular for creating single-page 
            applications (SPAs) and dynamic web applications.
        </dd>
        <br>

        <dt>LAMP Stack:</dt>
        <dd>
            The LAMP Stack comprises Linux (the operating system), Apache (the web server), MySQL (the relational 
            database management system), and PHP (a server-side scripting language). It is used for building 
            traditional web applications and websites.
        </dd>
        <br>

        <dt>JAMstack:</dt>
        <dd>
            JAMstack is an architecture for web development that stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. It promotes 
            decoupling the front end from the back end, relying on JavaScript for dynamic features, APIs for 
            data fetching, and pre-built Markup for faster performance.
        </dd>
        <br>

        <dt>Ruby on Rails:</dt>
        <dd>
            Ruby on Rails, often referred to as Rails, is a web application framework written in Ruby. It emphasizes 
            convention over configuration and is known for its developer-friendly features. Rails is used for 
            building web applications rapidly.
